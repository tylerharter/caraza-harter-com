<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to CS 368, the C++ programming section!  C and C++ are
fast: they are compiled (no interpreter overhead), don't have
background garbage collection, and give you control over memory
layout.  Both are excellent choices when performance matters.  C code
can usually be compiled by a C++ compiler, but C++ offers many
features beyond what C alone has, including classes, exceptions,
templates, functional programming, and a rich standard library.
Becoming proficient with C++ will enable you to build sophisticated
and performant applications and systems.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>Read and understand C++ code
	<li>Write C++ programs making use of the abstractions provided by the language
	<li>Understand the lower level details of memory management like pointers and references
	<li> Organize and build multi-file projects using the make tool
	<li>Solve real world programming problems using C++ as a tool
      </ul>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We will meet once a week in person and I'll also post recordings
between lectures I'll expect you to watch on your own before lecture.
See schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.  The recordings will be
heavy on programming demos -- to get the most out of them, I recommend
following along, writing code yourself and pausing as needed.

<p>I'll ask questions during lecture
via <a href="https://app.tophat.com/e/416879">TopHat</a>.  You can
earn points by answering questions (and getting them correct).

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

  <p></p>

<p>We'll cover everything you need to know in lecture, but if you're looking for extra resources, you could consider the following:

  <ul>
    <li>Tour of C++, A (C++ In-Depth Series), 3rd Edition by <i>Bjarne Stroustrup</i>
    <li>Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14, 1st Edition by <i>Scott Meyers</i>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Note that O'Reilly books are available for free via the Madison
  Public Library (the Meyers book is in the collection).  To get
  access:
  
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/library-cards/get-a-card#getcard">get a library card (free)</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/eresources/oreilly-public-libraries-tech-ebooks-and-digital-learning">sign into the O'Reilly collection with your card number</a>
      <li>search for a book
    </ol>  

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We'll message the class regularly
via <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/394986/announcements">Canvas
announcements</a>.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> page for a summary of all class forms.

  <h3>Grading</h3>

<p>This class is pass fail.  To pass, you need to earn at least 100 points.  Ways to earn points:

  <ul>
    <li>project: there will be 6 project milestones, each with 5 tests.  Passing a test gives you 4 points.
    <li>quizzes: there will be 6 quizzes, each with 5 questions.  Getting a question right gives you 1 point.
    <li>TopHat: I'll sometimes ask TopHat questions during lecture.  A correct answer is worth 1 point; an incorrect answer will get at least 0.5 points.
    <li>other: I might offer other opportunities for points as we go
  </ul> 

<h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>

<h4>TopHat</h4>

<p>Submitting TopHat answers while not physically present in class mis-represents participation, and is considered misconduct.

  <h4>Project</h4>

<p>Code copying between students is not allowed in this course.
Copying includes emailing, taking photos, looking while typing line by
line, etc.  Copying code then changing it is still copying and thus
not allowed.  Lock your compute when it's not attended.

<p><b>Citing ChatGPT (or other LLMs):</b> it's allowed with proper
citation.  To cite, have a directory named "chats" in your repository.
It should include complete screenshots of your interactions with these
tools.

<p><b>Citing Online Resources:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project you find online
  (that accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not
  OK.  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is
  to be completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Wednesdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with classmates who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of the course
    <li>discussing with classmates who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other students who broke the preceding rule
    <li>getting TA/instructor help on quiz questions prior to the quiz deadline
  </ul>
