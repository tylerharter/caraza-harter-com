<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<h3 class="mt-3">Course Description</h3>
<p>Welcome to your first programming course! CS 220 / CS 319 (Data Science Programming I) is a gentle introduction to coding for students outside of Computer Science. Our goal is simple: to write Python code to answer questions about real datasets. CS 220 / CS 319 will require you to practice coding a lot this semester. CS 220 students will complete 13 programming projects. CS 319 students will complete 9 programming projects and work on a self-chosen graduate level project. It's a lot of work, but if you take this course seriously and invest the time, you'll walk away with an incredible new skill: the ability to make computers work on your behalf. Students are required to have access to a laptop with MAC or Windows OS, where they can install Python, in order to complete projects for this course.</p>

<p>CS319 meets with CS220. Common aspects between CS319 and CS220: lectures, quizzes, exams, and first 9 programming projects.</p>

<h3>Graded Component Details</h3>

<p><b>Communication</b> is based on your online engagement (e.g., filling out surveys, Piazza contribution). Corresponding assignements will be created on Canvas.<br></p>

<b>Labs:</b> 
<ul>
	<li>You will be given a grade for each week's lab which is based on arriving on time, staying until the end of the lab, and participating in the lab activites.
	<li>There are 13 weekly labs. 
	<li>We will drop your three lowest lab scores, to account for any absences you may have for health, other coursework, or emergencies.
</ul>

<b>Projects:</b> 
<ul>
	<li>Primarily focus on your ability to write and debug code.<br>
	<li>Please see the course schedule for project due dates. Projects are due by 11:59pm Central Time on the day stated.
	<li>Students are required to have access to a laptop with MAC or Windows OS, where they can install Python.
	<li><b>Partnership:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>You may work alone, or with one project partner of your choosing. <b>We strongly encourage you to find a project partner.</b>
			<li>CS220 students can partner up with any other CS220 student, no matter which lecture they are enrolled in. We strongly recommend finding a project partner in the same lab. Students are not allowed to find a different partner just for the lab.
			<li>CS319 students are allowed to partner only with CS319 students.
		  	<li>Project partners <b>must not</b> work on alternating projects. Project partners <b>must not</b> split the project questions and work on separate half of the project. Both of these will be considered as cheating! The point of partners is to learn from your peers, not to do half the work.
			<li>Ideally, you and your partner would program in pairs (two people sitting in front of a screen at the same time). Take turns driving (i.e., writing code) and giving advice. This process is called pair programming.
		</ul>
	<li><b>Submission</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>For every project, you will be given an auto-grader test (test.py). It is your responsibility to run auto-grader tests on your local laptop, prior to submitting your project.
			<li>For each project you and your partner will upload a single .ipynb file  with the <a href="submission.html" target="_blank">submission tool</a>. 
			<li><strong>Only one partner should upload the project on behalf of both partners</strong>. Uploading two projects will result in our cheating detection tool flagging your work - this is bad. 
			<li>If you have any issues using the tool, make sure you're using the latest version of Chrome, because that is the only browser supported (and if that doesn't work, ask for help).
			<li>After submitting your project, you need to come back to the submission page to check auto-grader test results. These will typically be available within 4 hours of your submission.
			<li><b>IMPORTANT</b>: If your project did not clear auto-grader tests, it is your responsibility to attend office hours to figure out further details and get your project to clear auto-grader tests on time. If your code does not clear auto-grader tests, your project submission cannot be accepted. If you have been trying to get help for <i>48-hours</i> without any luck, you <i>must email your instructor</i>, to get further help.
		</ul>
	<li><b>Late Policy:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Students have a bank of 12 late days for the semester.
			<li>For a given project, you may use 3 late days without any deduction. After that, 5% deduction per late day, for the next 4 days. Projects which are late by more than 7 days will not be accepted.
			<li>After the bank runs out, 5% deduction will be applied per late day.
			<li>If a student's code fails on the server, late day rules take effect.
			<li>You <strong>may not</strong> use late days on the last project.
			<li>Late days only apply to projects. They do not apply to Quizzes.
		</ul>
	<li><b>Project Grading (Code Review):</b>
		<ul>
			<li>A TA will give you detailed comments on specific parts of your assignment. This feedback process is called a "code review". Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your work, we'll often give you tips to avoid losing points for future projects.
			<li>Project grading is <strong>results-oriented</strong>. That means it doesn't matter how much effort you put it; it only matters how well your code works. This means it is essential that your code runs. If we can't run your code for a project, you'll get a zero on that project, because the auto-grader tests will fail. We'll never fix the code for you, and we'll never manually give a better grade for code that "looks" almost correct. It is your responsibility to make sure your code clears auto-grader tests (test.py).
			<li>Grades will be based on auto-grader tests (test.py released with the project description) that we run and TA / grader evaluation of your code. 
			<li>Grades will be posted on canvas, typically before Wednesday of every week.
			<li>You may submit multiple versions of the project prior to the deadline. The TA / Grader will grade the latest submission prior to the deadline.
			<li><strong>Resubmission Regrade Requests: </strong> On projects p2 through p5 only, you are allowed to resubmit your project <strong>one time</strong> to make up only those specific points deducted in the Code Review. Regrade requests must be received within one week after project scores are posted on canvas. 
			<li>Here are the cases where you might get a different final grade than what you see when you run the tests:
				<ol>
					<li>Configuration Issues: There are ways to write code that will only work on certain computers (e.g., Windows but not on a Mac). We'll talk about these cases in class and teach you to write code that should be able to run anywhere. If you make a mistake that makes the tests fail for us even though you passed them yourself, we'll let you resubmit a corrected version (in a timely fashion).</li>
					<li>Faking: Sometimes, we will specify that you solve a problem in a specific way (so that you learn a particular skill). If, upon inspection of your code, we see you solved the problem in a way that doesn't meet the project specification, you'll lose points on that project (even if our automatic tests already tentatively gave you a better score).</li>
					<li>Being a bad partner: if your partner complains that you didn't do any work (or that you did all the work, refusing to let your partner write any code), you may lose points (we'll meet with both of you first to hear both sides, of course).</li>
					</ol>
			</ul>
		</ul>

<b>Quizzes:</b> 
<ul>
	<li>Help you assess your understanding of course content (lecture and readings).
	<li>Open notes, computer/internet use allowed, Python interpreter allowed.
	<li><b>No collaboration</b> allowed.
	<li>Quizzes will be on Canvas. The quizzes will be multiple-choice, multiple answer, multiple dropdown, matching or some other relevant canvas question style. 
	<li>Quizzes focus on content from recent lectures. Topics will be listed in the quiz instructions.</li>
	<li>Out of the 10 quizzes assigned, we will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores. This is meant to accommodate emergencies, technical difficulties, or other unforseen circumstances.  
	<li>Two attempts are provided for every quiz. The highest of the two scores will be recorded.
	<li>Quizzes must be completed before 11:59pm on the date specified. Please see the course schedule for quiz due dates.
</ul>

<b>Exams:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Measure your ability to read and understand code.
	<li>All lectures will have in-person exams. Location for in-person exams will be shared about a week before the exam date.
	<li>Exams are closed-book and closed-laptop. The exams will be multiple-choice scantron (use a #2 pencil). They are cumulative.
	<li>You will be allowed one 8.5-by-11 inch note sheet (printed or written) on both sides, which you must turn in with your exam.
	<li>Exam proctoring tools (eg: HonorLock) will be used if you need to take an online exam. Failure to use the proctoring service will result in a zero on the exam.
	<li>Please see the course schedule for midterm exam dates.
	<li>Please see your Student Center for final exam date.
</ul>


<h3>Letter Grades</h3>

<p>At the end of the semester, we will assign final grades based on these thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% - 100%: <strong>A</strong></li>
<li>88% - 92.99%: <strong>AB</strong></li>
<li>80% - 87.99%: <strong>B</strong></li>
<li>75% - 79.99%: <strong>BC</strong></li>
<li>70% - 74.99%: <strong>C</strong></li>
<li>60% - 69.99% <strong>D</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Letter grade ranges include decimal points, meaning we will NOT be rounding off scores at the end of the semester. No extra credit is given in this course. 

<h3>How to Succeed in This Course</h3>
Best way to succeed in this course would be to:
<ul>
	<li>attend in-person lectures with classroom engagement
	<li>attend and complete all labs prior to attempting projects
	<li>complete projects within the provided deadlines or by using a maximum of 3 late days
	<li>take weekly quiz attempt1 prior to Friday of every week
	<li>take weekly quiz attempt2 at least by Friday of every week
	<li>solve prior semester practice exam questions, to get sufficient preparation for exams
</ul>

<h3>Communication Tools</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://piazza.com/wisc/spring2022/sp22compsci220319/home" target="_blank">Piazza</a>:</strong> Here you can ask questions and see questions written by other students.  <b>Do not post code snippets that are more than 5 lines long.</b> This is considered cheating! Piazza contribution accounts for 0.5% of your grade. To get this credit, you must either ask a question or answer another student's question. You will have plenty of questions to ask this semester, so please don't ask redundant questions just to get grade!</li>
<li><strong>Office Hours:</strong> To visit Teaching Asisstant (TA) / Peer Mentor (PM) office hours please see the schedule at: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kyj7q1h7xpm1si?cid=9" target="_blank">Office Hours Schedule</a>. To visit instructors office hours please see the schedule at: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kyj7q1h7xpm1si?cid=10" target="_blank">Instructor Office Hours Schedule</a>. 
	<li> <strong>Email: </strong> Email is the <b><i>least-preferred</b></i> way of communication. Fast and easy way to get help in this course would be via Office hours. If you have a question about your project grading, send an email to the TA / grader who graded your project (Reviewer Contact Email). If you don't get a response within 48 hours, you must <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/sending-an-email-to-multiple-recipients-cc-and-bcc-1171178" target="_blank">CC</a> your instructor (see Course Instructors section for email). Please make sure to utilize Office Hours resources prior to sending any email.
<li><strong>Class Forms:</strong> We have <a href="surveys.html" target="_blank">various forms</a> for you to tell us things.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas:</strong> We'll periodically upload grades to <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/293969" target="_blank">Canvas (LEC001 through LEC004)</a>. Note that LEC001 through LEC004 are merged into LEC001 for Canvas.</li>
<li> <strong>Course Email: </strong> You'll receive announcement emails on either compsci220-<LEC #>-s22@g-groups.wisc.edu. You may also receive email from "no-reply@msyamkumar.com".</li>
</li>
</ol>


<!--
<h3>Lab</h3>
<p>We encourage you to work on your own laptops, but the labs have some Windows desktops you can use if you prefer. In order to sign onto the lab machines, you'll need to <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/computer-sciences-account-activation">activate your CS account</a>.</p>
-->

<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>Please notify the instructor for your lecture section within the first two weeks of classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you participate in religious observances that may conflict with course requirements.</li>
<li>If you have a VISA from the <a href="mcburney.html" target="_blank">McBurney Disability Resource Center</a>.</li>
<li>If you have any trouble accessing or using the technologies being used in this course (such as <!--the lab computers, -->Piazza, Canvas, and the course website).</li>
<li>If you need special accommodations for exams (or other components of the course). We'll do our best to accommodate you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cheating</h3>
<p>You shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating? This may not be obvious to people taking a CS course for the first time, so everybody should read this. The most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves copying code for programming projects. Here's an overview of what you can and cannot do:</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>any collaboration with your project partner</li>
<li>doing worksheets with non-project partners</li>
<li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that). If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the citation, you're plagiarizing).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOT Acceptable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>any form of code sharing (including algorithm sharing) with a non-project partner</b></li>
<li>stealing, looking at, copy / pasting, taking picture of non-project partner's code</li>
<li>project partners working separately on alternate projects</li>
<li>project partners working separately on one half of the project</li>
<li>you are <strong>not helping</strong> your friend by <strong>giving</strong> them your code.
</ul>
<p><strong>Similarity Detection:</strong> of course, with 900+ students, it's hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions. Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across submissions. Such similarity detection is an active area of Computer Science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the order of their code. We take cheating detection seriously to make the course fair to students who put in the honest effort.</p>
<p><strong>Citing Code:</strong> you can copy small snippets of code from stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them. For example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number from a list of numbers. I might search for "how to get the median of a list in python" and find a solution at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.</p>
<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as it has a comment as follows:</p>
<pre class="example">  # copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
  def median(lst):
    sortedLst = sorted(lst)
    lstLen = len(lst)
    index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

    if (lstLen % 2):
      return sortedLst[index]
    else:
      return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
</pre>
<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK. When in doubt, ask us! The best way to stay out of trouble is to be completely transparent about what you're doing.</p>

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write Python code. We will implement all of the concepts and ideas from the course using Python 3.</li>
<li>Communicate using Computer Science terminology. Using the language of programming to talk about concepts helps ease the exchange of ideas between programmers.</li>
<li>Build large projects in small steps. Creating milestones and breaking large programs down into smaller functions makes complicated projects more achievable.</li>
<li>Process data from existing files without manual processing. Dealing with large datasets is much more efficient and less error-prone when the process can be automated.</li>
<li>Manipulate quantitative information to create models, and/or devise solutions to problems using multi-step arguments, based on and supported by quantitative information.</li>
<li>Evaluate models and arguments using quantitative information.</li>
<li>Express and interpret in context models, solutions and/or arguments using verbal, numerical, graphical, algorithmic, computational, or symbolic techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit Hour Policy</strong>: Traditional Carnegie Definition – One hour (i.e. 50 minutes) of classroom or direct faculty/instructor instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week over approximately 15 weeks, or an equivalent amount of engagement over a different number of weeks. This is the status quo and represents the traditional college credit format used for decades. If you have regular classroom meetings and assign homework, reading, writing, and preparation for quizzes and exams, make this choice.</p>

<p><strong>Regular and Substantive Student-Instructor Interaction</strong>: Substantive interaction is engaging students in teaching, learning and assessment through at least two of the following: direct instruction, providing feedback on student work, providing information about course content, facilitating discussion of course content, or other substantive interaction. Regular interaction is: predictable and scheduled interaction with students consistent with the course length (usually at least weekly but more often in a course of short duration). Regular and substantive student-instructor interaction, as defined by the US Department of Education (Within 34 C.F.R. §600.2), is always a requirement of UW-Madison for-credit learning activities. Find more information including examples of regular and substantive instruction.  

<p><strong>Official Course Description</strong>: Introduction to Data Science programming using Python. No previous programming experience required. Emphasis on analyzing real datasets in a variety of forms and visual communication. Recommended for Data Science majors and other majors</p>

<p><strong>Course Evaluations</strong>: UW-Madison now uses an online course evaluation survey tool, AEFIS. In most instances, you 	will receive an official email two weeks prior to the end of the semester when your course 	evaluation is available. You will receive a link to log into the course evaluation with your NetID 	where you can complete the evaluation and submit it, anonymously. Your participation is an 	integral component of this course, and your feedback is important to me. I strongly encourage 	you to participate in the course evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong>: By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action. Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</strong>: The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [instructors] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.</p>

<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong>: Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals. The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.
