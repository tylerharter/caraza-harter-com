<h1 class="mt-5">Class Forms</h1>

<p>For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to fill in this
  form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to verify who you
  are.  If you try using a different signin on one of these, you'll
  see an error saying "You need permission: This form can only be
  viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>

      target="_blank">3. Grading Issues</a>: Fill this if there was a grading mistake or you got permission from your TA to resubmit.  Please check out the <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/343506/pages/cs320-staff" target="_blank">CS320 staff</a> page for more details on when you should fill this form.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/iE2YvLe3D6RqBJBq6"
target="_blank">4. Feedback form</a>: If you have any issues with the
class or suggestions for improvement, please let us know sooner rather
than later; we may be able to make changes more rapidly than you might
imagine. This is optionally anonymous, but it's always nice to know
who you are (sometimes it makes sense to have followup
conversations).</p>

target="_blank">5. Thank You form</a>:
    Has a TA or mentor provided exceptional help, during office hours, lab, etc?
    Thank them by filling out this form, and I'll pass along the
  feedback.

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/22j4Q5yVz74ZJdfC6" target="_blank">6. TopHat technical issue reporting form</a>: 
If you encounter technical issues with TopHat, you can fill this form out. You must come and tell me your name at the end of the lecture (I will not be considering email / some other means of communication from you for this purpose). Even if there is a queue of student to ask questions, I will first ask if anyone has TopHat technical problems to report. You can give me your name and quickly leave if you have to attend another lecture / lab / discussion for another course. I plan to mark names off when I get this information. So, if you fill this form out outside of that process, it is easy for me to ignore your request. This form will send you a copy of your response - please retain that email for your reference. I will monitor the form response history. If you constantly keep reporting technical issues (more than 3 times), I will ask you to come have a conversation with me during office hours.

<p>For forms requiring authentication, make sure you sign in with your @wisc.edu, like this:
