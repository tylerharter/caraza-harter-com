<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Science Programming II!  In this course, we will learn
object-oriented programming to create tree and graph data structures
to represent hierarchical data and implement algorithms for
efficiently searching these structures.

<p>We'll often create our own datasets, using techniques like logging,
benchmarking, web scraping, and A/B testing.

<p>In the last third of the semester we'll explore some basic machine
learning techniques, including regression, classification, clustering,
and decomposition.

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We message the class regularly
via <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/343506/announcements">Canvas
announcements</a>.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help page</a> for details about how to contact us.

<p>We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
    (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank
    TAs/mentors.

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture
schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.  In the past, I've always
posted lecture recordings online, but I'm not making any guarantees.
If attendance is healthy (at least 75% of the section students show up) and it
feels like people are keeping up, I'll usually be posting recordings. If the attendance
drops, I will stop posting recordings (warning will be issued one lecture prior to this change).

<h3>Lab</h3>

<ul>
	<li>We'll post a weekly lab document. You can work through it individually, or with your assigned study group. TAs and mentors will walk around to answer questions that might arise.
	<li>If you have extra time at lab after completing the lab doc, you must work with your assigned study group on the project. You are <b>not allowed</b> to work on quizzes during the lab.
	<li>We'll be taking lab attendance for participation. Every lab attendance is allocated 5 points:
	<ul>
		<li>1 point for arriving within the first 5 minutes and <b>picking up your name tag</b>. You are <b>not allowed</b> to pick up name tag for your friend. First time warning will be issued. Subsequent times you will lose your own lab attendance. Please do not help anyone fake their lab attendance.
		<li>3 points for actively completing the lab
		<li>1 point for staying at least until 5 minutes before the end of the lab and <b>returning your name tag</b>
		<li>You must follow the process of picking up name tag at the beginning and leaving it at the end. TAs will remind you to do this every lab. TAs will take picture of the leftover name tags 5 to 7 minutes into the lab. If your name tag is in the picture, then you will lose 1 point for late attendance. 
	</ul>
	<li>There are 13 weekly labs.
	<li>We will drop your three lowest lab scores, to account for any absences you may have for health, other coursework, or emergencies. Score drops happen automatically - you do not have to email anyone about missing lab. If you miss a lab, we expect you to complete the lab during your own time.
</ul>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>42%</b> - 7 projects (6% each)
    <li><b>10%</b> - 10 online quizzes (1% each)
    <li><b>14%</b> - exam 1
    <li><b>14%</b> - exam 2
    <li><b>16%</b> - exam 3
    <li><b>4%</b> - participation
  </ul>

<p>At the end, you'll have a score out of 100, and I'll set a curve
based on where there are obvious breaks in the distribution and the
difficulty this semester (there are not a capped numbers of A's, so
you're not really competing with your peers).

  <h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
  file or a .ipynb (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a group part to be
optionally done with your assigned study group and (2) an individual
part.  For the group part, any form of help from anybody on your group
is allowed (even looking at each other's code); I recommend you find
times for everybody on the group to work at the same time so you can
help each other through coding difficulties in this part.  You're also
welcome to do the "group" part individually, or with a subset of your
assigned study group.  For the individual part, you may only receive help
from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you may not discuss this
part with anybody else (in the class or otherwise) or get help from
them.

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> if you submit a version of your project on time
that is scoring at least 50 percent with the tester, you may have up
to 3 extra days to complete the project (no penalty and no explanation
required).  If you have other special circumstances (e.g., illness,
family emergency), email me asking for accomodations.  Before making
such a request, submit current progress on the submission and link to
your code (I'm more generous if I see somebody started early and made
a good effort).

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be largely based on automatic
  tests that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due
  date, so you should rarely be too surprised by your grade.  Though
  it shouldn't be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding,
  not following directions, or other issues.  Some bugs (called
  non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
  you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
  the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.
  Finally, our tests aren't very good at evaluating whether plots and
  other visualizations look how they should (a human usually needs to
  evaluate that).

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> The autograder will be run periodically
during 2 days days prior to a project deadline (from Monday night if
the deadline is on Wednesday and so on). Because of this, we expect
you to try submitting your project early and make sure nothing
crashes. However, this should not be a substitute for running
tester.py locally. You should only try submitting once you pass the
tests locally.

<p><b>Allowed Packages:</b> anything that comes pre-installed with
Python may be used.  Additionally, you may install and use the
following if they're useful: <i>jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
requests, beautifulsoup4, statistics, recordclass, sklearn, haversine,
gitpython, graphviz, pylint, lxml, flask, bs4, html5lib, geopandas,
shapely, descartes, click, netaddr, torch==1.4.0+cpu, torch
vision=0.5.0+cpu</i>.  Using unapproved packages will result in a
score of zero when submitted for grading because the autograder won't
be able to run your code without those packages.

  <h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Fridays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned study group who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your group
    <li>discussing with members of your group who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
  </ul>

  <h3>Midterms and Final</h3>

  <p>These will be multiple choice exams taken in person.  The midterms
  will be in class, the final will be at a different location (to be announced).

  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>Some of the things that count towards participation:

    <ul>
      <li>lab attendendance (most important)
      <li>filling class surveys
      <li>accepted pull requests fixing issues with project specifications
      <li>instructor endorsed piazza contributions (be sure to use your NETID@wisc.edu email so we can identify you)
      <li>other...
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll sometimes assign readings from the following sources (all free):

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>

</ul>

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your assigned study group members on the group part of a project
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the citation, you're plagarizing).
    <li>using ChatGPT to ask simple questions. For example: how do I use "self" inside class constructor?
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>using ChatGPT to solve project questions in entirety - please note that this will lead to moss detecting your work as plagiarism
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the group part from anybody who is not either (a) on your assigned study group or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>reporting lab attendance for yourself or someone else who didn't actually attend (dropping in for a few minutes is not "attending")
    <li>counting lab attendance as merely showing up without spending substantial time on the assigned lab activities
    <li>using TopHat while not actually physically present in the room (since we sometimes use this for attendance)
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with about 400+ students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.
  
  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p> Due to being on maternity break, I will not be able to write recommendation letters
for Fall2023 deadlines. Please approach other Professors with whom you have taken a course.
