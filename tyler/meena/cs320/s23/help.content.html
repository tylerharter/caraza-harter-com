<h1 class="mt-5">Getting Help</h1>

<p>Most students ask for help at some point during the semester.  Some
regularly come to office hours weekly -- that's welcome as well!

<h3>In-Person+Zoom Help</h3>
  
<p>Office hours are "walk in" during scheduled times -- no need to
email to setup an appointment.  Check the <a target="_blank"
href="">Office
Hour Schedule (To be updated)</a> to see your options.

<p>Depending on the time and day, we offer office hours online (Zoom), at Meena's office (CS 7390), and at CSXXXX (location: To be updated)

<p> For online office hours, be
sure to join the queue (link on queue) so we can track what order to
help people.

<p>If you need an instructor appointment outside of office hours, please email me (ms@cs.wisc.edu) about availability.

<h3>Other Online Help</h3>

<p>If you have a question of general interest, you can ask
    on <a href="https://piazza.com/wisc/spring2023/sp23compsci320001">Piazza</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's
    considered cheating.</span>

<p>We don't enable private questions on Piazza.  If you have a private
question, only relevant to yourself (and perhaps your study group),
directly email your <a href="messages.html?topic=group">group TA</a>.
If you have a question about your code, please
first <a href="https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs320/f22/submission.html">submit</a>
your latest draft and include a link to your code in the email (don't
use email attachments because Outlook often blocks Python code).  If
you don't hear back from your TA within 2 business days, feel free to
CC the instructor and the head TA Yiyin (yshen82@wisc.edu).

  Everybody's contact info is <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/343506/pages/cs320-staff">here</a>.

<h3>Extra Support/Accomodations</h3>

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can be
barriers to learning. These might include isolation related to
COVID-19, strained relationships, anxiety, high levels of stress,
alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, loss of loved one, and/or loss of
motivation. Services exist on campus
to support students who find themselves in these situations, like University Health Services and
the Dean of Students Office. You can learn more about free,
confidential mental health services at UHS by calling 608-265-5600
Opt. 2 or visiting
<a href="https://uhs.wisc.edu">uhs.wisc.edu</a>. Drop-in staff are available daily at the Dean of
Students Office to support students and answer questions. To learn
more about the Dean of Students Office (DOSO), please call 608-263-5700 or
visit <a href="https://doso.students.wisc.edu">doso.students.wisc.edu</a>.

<p>In general, if you have any issues keeping up with the course for
any reason, it's better to let me know -- I'll do my best to connect
you with resources and try to think of accomodations to help out.  I
want to do whatever I can to help you succeed.

<h3>Student Grievance Procedure</h3>

<p>Any student at UW–Madison who feels that they have been treated unfairly has the right to voice a complaint and receive a prompt hearing of the grievance. The basis for a grievance can range from something as subtle as miscommunication to the extreme of harassment.

<p>Ensuring that all students feel welcome and supported is a top priority of our department. The Department of Computer Sciences has developed procedures to handle complaints or incidents that are student-related, such as bias or mistreatment, or academic, such as a grade dispute or incident with an instructor. Information on the CS reporting procedures can be found here: <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/report-an-incident/">https://www.cs.wisc.edu/report-an-incident/</a>.

<p>For assistance in determining options, students can also contact the drop-in staff member with DOSO (see above).
