<h1 class="my-5">McBurney</h1>

<p>The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all
enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute
(36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that
students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction
and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students
are expected to inform faculty [me] of their need for instructional
accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as
soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or
recognized. Faculty [I], will work either directly with the student
[you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and
provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability
information, including instructional accommodations as part of a
student's educational record, is confidential and protected under
FERPA.

<p>In addition to completing an electronic Faculty Notification Letter
request through McBurney Connect, students must also contact the
instructor [me] directly by the end of the third week of the semester
to set up a meeting to discuss the necessary accommodations. The
instructor [I] may be unable to meet accommodation requests for
students who fail to initiate a meeting by the end of the third week
of the semester.
