<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Programming II!  We'll be building on what you
learned in Data Programming I.  In that course, we mostly worried
about getting the code <b>correct</b> -- in the first part of 320,
we'll start thinking about how to make it <b>efficient</b>.  Next,
we'll be learning more about the <b>Internet</b> (among other things,
you'll build a simple website for distributing a dataset)
and <b>advanced visualizations</b> (like maps and animations).  We'll
conclude the course with a light introduction to <b>machine
learning</b> with the sklearn package.

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

<p>Most students ask for help at some point during the semester.  Some
regularly come to office hours weekly -- that's welcome as well!

<p>Office hours are "walk in" -- no need to schedule.  Check
the <a target="_blank"
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l9EDqiHG9l7lXpMVNLF4yHN3AEfK4QD_IHtdlKj3glE/edit?usp=sharing">Office
  Hour Schedule</a> to see your options.

<p>Before 6pm, office hours are in person at the Shelf (platform above entrance to CS building):

<p>After 6pm, all help is via Zoom (see links in schedule).</a>

<h3>Online Communication</h3>

<p>Besides email (described above), there are four ways we'll
  communicate outside of class.

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> You can ask questions (and see the other
  questions) <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kskk56h2ohc7lg">here</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's considered
    cheating.</span>

<p><b>2. Canvas:</b> We'll make announcements on Canvas and
  periodically upload grades there (detailed feedback will only be on
  this site, however)

<p><b>3. Class Forms:</b> We have <a href="surveys.html">various
    forms</a> for us to leave (optionally anonymous) feedback and report
  exam conflicts.

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
  using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tool, TAs
  will leave comments on your code.  <span class="text-danger">Even
    projects scoring 100% often have a lot of room for improvement, so
    please take these seriously</span>.  When submitting, you can ask for
  specific kinds of feedback, based on what coding skills you're most
  interested in developing.

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p> We'll post a weekly lab document.  You can work through it
  individually, or with your assigned group.  TAs and mentors will walk
  around to answer questions that might arise.

<p>If you have extra time at lab after completing the lab doc, you may
  leave early, or (probably better) work with your assigned group on the
  project or quizzes.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>49%</b> - 7 projects (7% each)
    <li><b>10%</b> - 10 online quizzes (1% each)
    <li><b>10%</b> - exam 1
    <li><b>12%</b> - exam 2
    <li><b>15%</b> - exam 3
    <li><b>4%</b> - participation
  </ul>

<p>At the end, you'll have a score out of 100, and I'll set a curve.

  <h3>Projects</h3>

  <h5>Overview</h5>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
  file or a .ipynb (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a group part and
(2) an individual part.  For the group part, any form of help from
anybody on your group is allowed (even looking at each other's code);
I recommend you find times for everybody on the group to work at the
same time so you can help each other through coding difficulties in
this part.  You're also welcome to do the "group" part individually,
or with a subset of your assigned group.  For the individual part, you
may only receive help from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you
may not discuss this part with anybody else (in the class or
otherwise) or get help from them.

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> if you submit a version of your project on time
that is scoring at least 50 percent with the tester, you may have up
to 3 extra days to complete the project (no penalty and no explanation
required).  If you have other special circumstances (e.g., illness,
family emergency), email me asking for accomodations.  Along with this
email, submit whatever you have completed.

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be largely based on automatic
  tests that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due
  date, so you should rarely be too surprised by your grade.  Though
  it shouldn't be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding,
  not following directions, or other issues.  Some bugs (called
  non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
  you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
  the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.
  Finally, our tests aren't very good at evaluating whether plots and
  other visualizations look how they should (a human usually needs to
  evaluate that).

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> The autograder will be run periodically
during 2 days days prior to a project deadline (from Monday night if
the deadline is on Wednesday and so on). Because of this, we expect
you to try submitting your project early and make sure nothing
crashes. However, this should not be a substitute for running
tester.py locally. You should only try submitting once you pass the
tests locally.

<h5>Allowed Packages</h5>

<p>Please use standard packages in python for the assignment.</p>

<p>The following packages are allowed for use in all the projects:
jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, beautifulsoup4,
statistics, recordclass, sklearn, haversine, gitpython, graphviz,
pylint, lxml, flask, bs4, html5lib, geopandas, shapely, descartes,
click, netaddr, torch==1.4.0+cpu, torch vision=0.5.0+cpu.</p>

<p>Using specialized packages will result in a score of zero when
submitted for grading. Please contact TA if you are not sure how to
code something without specialized packages or for the possibility to
use for specialised packages.</p>
  
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Wednesdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned group who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your group
    <li>discussing with members of your group who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
  </ul>

  <p>There will also be practice quizzes corresponding to each real
  quiz.  These are optional, and there are no rules about how you may
  use them to practice.

  <h3>Midterm and Final</h3>

  <p>These will be multiple choice exams taken in person.  The midterm
  will be in class, the final will be at a different location (to be announced).

  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>Some of the things that could count towards participation:

  <ul>
    <li>filling class surveys
    <li>accepted pull requests to s22 project repo
    <li>instructor endorsed piazza contributions
    <li>other...
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> by Al Sweigart: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Principles and Techniques of Data Science</i> by Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan: <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org/intro.html">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Scipy Lecture Notes</i> by many contributors: <a href="http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html">Read Online</a>
</ul>


<h3>Extra Support/Accomodations</h3>

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can be
barriers to learning. These might include isolation related to
COVID-19, strained relationships, anxiety, high levels of stress,
alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, loss of loved one, and/or loss of
motivation. Services exist on campus
to support students who find themselves in these situations, like University Health Services and
the Dean of Students Office. You can learn more about free,
confidential mental health services at UHS by calling 608-265-5600
Opt. 2 or visiting
<a href="https://uhs.wisc.edu">uhs.wisc.edu</a>. Drop-in staff are available daily at the Dean of
Students Office to support students and answer questions. To learn
more about the Dean of Students Office, please call 608-263-5700 or
visit <a href="https://doso.students.wisc.edu">doso.students.wisc.edu</a>.

<p>In general, if you have any issues keeping up with the course for
any reason, it's better to let me know -- I'll do my best to connect
you with resources and try to think of accomodations to help out.  I
want to do whatever I can to help you succeed.

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your group members on the group part of a project
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the group part from anybody who is not either (a) on your assigned group or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>reporting lab attendance for yourself or someone else who didn't actually attend
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with about 400 students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
