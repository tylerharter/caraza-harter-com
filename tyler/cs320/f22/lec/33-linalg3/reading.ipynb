    "# Solving for N Variables Given M Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be been exposed to the idea that you can usually solve for N variables when you have N equations.  For regression, the coefficient we're trying to find for each column is a variable, and every row can be used to generate an equation.  For tall skinny tables, then, we have a problem: more equations than variables.  Sometimes this is solveable (for example, maybe some rows are repeated, such that there are fewer unique equations than one may initially assume), but most often it is not.  Our strategy: tweak the y values (as little as possible!) to create a solveable problem.\n",

We then tried to solve (2) `c = np.linalg.solve(X, p)`, which was mathematically solveable, but which made numpy unhappy.  If we go back to expression (1), and multiply both X and y with X.T in front, we get this: (3) `c = np.linalg.solve(X.T@X, X.T@y)`; numpy usually accepts this, and the c we get from (3) happens to be the solution for (2).  Another nice thing about this last formula is that it's relatively fast to compute relative to computing the projection matrix: we can find what c would be if we were to compute p, but without ever computing vector p (or matrix P!)."
