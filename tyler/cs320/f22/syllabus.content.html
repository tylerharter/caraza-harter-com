<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Programming II!  In this course, we will learn
object-oriented programming to create tree and graph data structures
to represent hierarchical data and implement algorithms for
efficiently searching these structures.

<p>We'll often create our own datasets, using techniques like logging,
benchmarking, web scraping, and A/B testing.

<p>In the last third of the semester we'll explore some basic machine
learning techniques, including regression, classification, clustering,
and decomposition.

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We message the class regularly
via <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/322105/announcements">Canvas
announcements</a>.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help page</a> for details about how to contact us.

<p>We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
    (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank
    TAs/mentors.

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture
schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.  In the past, I've always
posted lecture recordings online, but I'm not making any guarantees.
The problem I've seen recently is that people plan to watch online but
then procrastinate and fall behind.  If attendance is healthy and it
feels like people are keeping up, I'll usually be posting recordings.

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p> We'll post a weekly lab document.  You can work through it
  individually, or with your assigned study group.  TAs and mentors
  will walk around to answer questions that might arise.

<p>If you have extra time at lab after completing the lab doc, you may
  leave early, or (probably better) work with your assigned study
  group on the project or quizzes.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>42%</b> - 7 projects (6% each)
    <li><b>10%</b> - 10 online quizzes (1% each)
    <li><b>14%</b> - exam 1
    <li><b>14%</b> - exam 2
    <li><b>16%</b> - exam 3
    <li><b>4%</b> - participation
  </ul>

<p>At the end, you'll have a score out of 100, and I'll set a curve
based on where there are obvious breaks in the distribution and the
difficulty this semester (there are not a capped numbers of A's, so
you're not really competing with your peers).

  <h3>Projects</h3>

  <h5>Overview</h5>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
  file or a .ipynb (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a group part to be
optionally done with your assigned study group and (2) an individual
part.  For the group part, any form of help from anybody on your group
is allowed (even looking at each other's code); I recommend you find
times for everybody on the group to work at the same time so you can
help each other through coding difficulties in this part.  You're also
welcome to do the "group" part individually, or with a subset of your
assigned study group.  For the individual part, you may only receive help
from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you may not discuss this
part with anybody else (in the class or otherwise) or get help from
them.

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> if you submit a version of your project on time
that is scoring at least 50 percent with the tester, you may have up
to 3 extra days to complete the project (no penalty and no explanation
required).  If you have other special circumstances (e.g., illness,
family emergency), email me asking for accomodations.  Before making
such a request, submit current progress on the submission and link to
your code (I'm more generous if I see somebody started early and made
a good effort).

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be largely based on automatic
  tests that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due
  date, so you should rarely be too surprised by your grade.  Though
  it shouldn't be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding,
  not following directions, or other issues.  Some bugs (called
  non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
  you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
  the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.
  Finally, our tests aren't very good at evaluating whether plots and
  other visualizations look how they should (a human usually needs to
  evaluate that).

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> The autograder will be run periodically
during 2 days days prior to a project deadline (from Monday night if
the deadline is on Wednesday and so on). Because of this, we expect
you to try submitting your project early and make sure nothing
crashes. However, this should not be a substitute for running
tester.py locally. You should only try submitting once you pass the
tests locally.

<h5>Allowed Packages</h5>

<p>Please use standard packages in python for the assignment.</p>

<p>The following packages are allowed for use in all the projects:
jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, beautifulsoup4,
statistics, recordclass, sklearn, haversine, gitpython, graphviz,
pylint, lxml, flask, bs4, html5lib, geopandas, shapely, descartes,
click, netaddr, torch==1.4.0+cpu, torch vision=0.5.0+cpu.</p>

<p>Using specialized packages will result in a score of zero when
submitted for grading. Please contact TA if you are not sure how to
code something without specialized packages or for the possibility to
use for specialised packages.</p>
  
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Wednesdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned study group who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your group
    <li>discussing with members of your group who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
  </ul>

  <h3>Midterms and Final</h3>

  <p>These will be multiple choice exams taken in person.  The midterms
  will be in class, the final will be at a different location (to be announced).

  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>Some of the things that count towards participation:

    <ul>
      <li>lab attendendance (most important)
      <li>filling class surveys
      <li>accepted pull requests fixing issues with project specifications
      <li>instructor endorsed piazza contributions
      <li>other...
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

</ul>

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your assigned study group members on the group part of a project
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the group part from anybody who is not either (a) on your assigned study group or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>reporting lab attendance for yourself or someone else who didn't actually attend
    <li>counting lab attendance as merely showing up without spending substantial time on the assigned lab activities
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with about 400 students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
