<h1 class="mt-5">Class Forms</h1>

<p>For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to fill in this
  form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to verify who you
  are.  If you try using a different signin on one of these, you'll
  see an error saying "You need permission: This form can only be
  viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/kZYhHfhbEhDsRVW88"
target="_blank">1. Who are you?</a>  To help us better understand who
is taking this class, please fill this out.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/nNpVEGTpYcW5Bsyc8"
target="_blank">2. Feedback Form.</a>  If you have any issues with the
class or suggestions for improvement, please let us know sooner rather
than later; we may be able to make changes more rapidly than you might
imagine.  This is optionally anonymous, but it's always nice to know
who you are (sometimes it makes sense to have followup
conversations).</p>

<p>3. Exam Scheduling Conflicts.  Please try your best to make the
regular time, but we'll work with you if you have a hard conflict.
Please use the appropriate from below to let us know.  Note that you
shouldn't fill this out if you have McBurney accommodations (we'll be
working with you to schedule separately).  Make sure to report
scheduling conflicts at least 10 days in advance.</p>
