<p>Welcome to your Data Programming II!

  <h3 class="mt-3">Additions To Syllabus Made During Semester</h3>

<p>None yet...
  
  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> by Al Sweigart: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Read Online</a>
  <li>Course Notes (we'll sometimes write these ourselves)
</ul>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

There are a few ways to get help:
<ul>
  <li>Check for walk-in office hours (instructor and TA): go to "Resources" menu and click "Office Hours"
  <li>Find your TA's name and email <a href="status.html">here</a>
  <li>Email me at tharter@wisc.edu to schedule an appointment outside of office hour time
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we won't have peer mentors this first semester,
because there's nobody who has previously taken the course that we
could hire.  If you like helping people and do reasonable well in CS
320, please consider applying (at the end of the semester) to be a
peer mentor for this course in future semesters.  It pays $13/hour.

  <h3>Online Communication</h3>

<p>Besides email (described above), there are four ways we'll
  communicate outside of class.

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> You can ask questions (and see the other
  questions) <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jzkcu4am8lmc3">here</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's considered
    cheating.</span>

<p><b>2. Canvas:</b> We'll make announcements on Canvas and
  periodically upload grades there (detailed feedback will only be on
  this site, however)

<p><b>3. Class Forms:</b> We have <a href="surveys.html">various
    forms</a> for us to leave (optionally anonymous) feedback and report
  exam conflicts.

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
  using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tool, TAs
  will leave comments on your code.  <span class="text-danger">Even
    projects scoring 100% often have a lot of room for improvement, so
    please take these seriously</span>.  When submitting, you can ask for
  specific kinds of feedback, based on what coding skills you're most
  interested in developing.

  <h3>Lab</h3>

<p>Each week, we'll post a lab document with exercises you can work on
  to solidify what we've covered in class.  Sometimes we'll also
  introduce topics we didn't have time for in lecture.  The emphasis
  will usually be on preparing for the project,
  so <span class="text-danger">make sure you work through the weekly lab
    before asking us for help on the project</span>.

<p>Lab exercises are ungraded, and you're free to do them from home.
  However, we encourage you to do them during your scheduled lab time.
  This gives you an opportunity meet other 32 students and to get help
  from the TAs and mentors running the lab.  You can also use this time
  to ask questions about the projects or other course material if you
  like.

<p>We encourage you to work on your own laptops, but the labs have
  some Windows desktops you can use if you prefer.  In order to sign
  onto the lab machines, you'll need
  to <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/computer-sciences-account-activation">activate
    your CS account</a>.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading is based six projects, each worth 10% of your grade, and
two exams, each worth 20% of your grade.

<p>At the end of the semester, we'll look at the distribution of
  scores and set a curve, with thresholds for each letter grade.  When
  setting the curve, we'll guarantee the following:

  <ul>
    <li>at least 95% guarantees an <b>A</b>
    <li>at least 85% guarantees a <b>B</b> (or better)
    <li>at least 70% guarantees a <b>C</b> (or better)
    <li>at least 60% guarantees a <b>D</b> (or better)
  </ul>

  <h3>Exams</h3>

<p>Exams are closed-book and closed-laptop.  The exams will be
  multiple-choice scantron (use a #2 pencil).  They are cumulative.

<p>You will be allowed one 8.5-by-11 inch notesheet (may be printed or
  written on both sides), which you must turn in with your exam.

<p>We'll schedule a McBurney exam with 1.5x time accomodations.  Feel
  free to email us if you need other accomodations. More information
  about McBurney is <a href="mcburney.html">here</a>.
  
<p>Exam Times:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Midterm:</b> TBD
    <li><b>Final:</b> TBD
  </ul>

<p>Find your location <a href="status.html">here</a>.  Report any exam
  conflicts at least 10 days in
  advance <a href="surveys.html">here</a>.

  <h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 7 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  You may use all your late
  days on the same project, if you like.  Using late days on a project
  does not defer the deadline for subsequent projects, so be careful
  not to let work pile up.  You <b>may not</b> use late days on the
  last project.  Late days are automatically applied if a project is
  turned in late.  After late days are exhausted, anything late will
  receive zero credit by default.  Please talk to me if you're falling
  this far behind.

<p><b>Partners:</b> You may work alone, or with one project partner of
  your choosing.  You can partner with different people for different
  projects if you like.  You may also partner with people in a
  different section of CS 320.  You and your partner should program in
  pairs (two people sitting in front of a screen at the same time).
  Take turns driving (i.e., writing code) and giving advice.  The
  point of partners is to learn from your peers, not to do half the
  work.  Some exam questions will be specifically written to find
  cases where a one partner does the work and the other partner does
  not understand what is going on.

<p><b>Submission:</b> You will upload either a .py file or a .ipynb
  (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.  Only one partner
  should upload the project on behalf of both people.  If you have any
  issues using the tool, make sure you're using the latest version of
  Chrome, because that is the only browser I support (and if that
  doesn't work, I'll help you troubleshoot).

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be based on automatic tests
  that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due date, so
  you should rarely be surprised by your grade.  Here are the cases
  where you might get a different final grade than what you see when
  you run the tests:

  <ol>
    <li><b>Configuration Issues:</b> There are ways to write code that
      will only work on certain computers (e.g., Windows but not on a
      Mac).  We'll talk about these cases in class and teach you to
      write code that should be able to run anywhere.  If you make a
      mistake that makes the tests fail for us even though you passed
      them yourself, we'll let you resubmit a corrected version (in a
      timely fashion).  You should also check with us before using any
      pip packages that we may not support.
    <li><b>Randomness:</b> There are some bugs in code that don't
      causes problems every time, resulting in tests sometimes failing
      and sometimes passing.  As in the "Configuration Issues" case,
      we'll work with you to let you fix the issue.
    <li><b>Cheating:</b> obviously if you cheated (e.g., copied
      another student's code), the tests are irrelevant, and you have
      much bigger things to worry about than your grade on a particular
      assignment.
    <li><b>Faking:</b> sometimes, we will specify that you solve a
      problem in a specific way (so that you learn a particular skill).
      If, upon inspection of your code, we see you solved the problem in
      a way that doesn't meet the project specification, you'll lose
      points on that project (even if our automatic tests already
      tentatively gave you a better score).  Or, if your code is written
      specifically to defeat the tests, you'll lose points
      (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">this
        wikipedia article</a> for an example of a defeat device in the
      real world).  For example, suppose your program is supposed to
      take the length of a square's side as input and then output the
      area of a square, and we have a test that verifies your program
      outputs 100 when we input 10.  If you submit a program that always
      outputs 100 (regardless of the input) because you know we only
      test with 10, you'll lose points.
    <li><b>Being a bad partner:</b> if your partner complains that you
      didn't do any work (or that you did all the work, refusing to let
      your partner write any code), you may lose points (we'll meet with
      you first to hear your side, of course).
  </ol>

<p>Project grading is <b>results-oriented</b>.  That means it doesn't
  matter how much effort you put it; it only matters how well your code
  works.  This means it is essential that your code runs.  If we can't
  run your code for a project, you'll get a zero on that project,
  because the tests will fail.  We'll never fix the code for you, and
  we'll never manually give a better grade for code that "looks" almost
  correct.

  <h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your project partner
    <li>talking about code (without looking at it or reading it aloud) with anybody
    <li>sharing pseudocode/diagrams with anybody
    <li>pointing friends to online resources (Piazza, Stackoverflow, etc.)
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>looking at somebody else's project code and typing it line-by-line
    <li>copying/pasting code to/from a non-partner (with or without citation)
    <li>emailing your code to another student
    <li>taking pictures of project solutions
    <li>accessing project code from previous semesters
  </ul>

<p>One action that students wonder about is whether it's acceptable to
  LOOK at another student's code.  While this is not strictly
  forbidden, it's often dangerous.  Many students find it difficult to
  look without ultimately copying.  What's somewhat safer is when a
  student who has completed a problem looks at the code of a student
  still working on the problem.  In this case, the more-advanced
  student can often provide useful advice and debugging tips that help
  the less-advanced student without causing the less-advanced student
  to copy code.  Just make sure the more-advanced student isn't
  telling the less-advanced student exactly what to type, line by
  line.  The more advanced student shouldn't be looking back at their
  own code either during this.

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with &gt;100 students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
    sortedLst = sorted(lst)
    lstLen = len(lst)
    index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

    if (lstLen % 2):
    return sortedLst[index]
    else:
    return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  I'll want to see you doing something complex and
interesting beyond the assingments.  Most grad schools require
recommenders to fill long forms rating students on various abilities,
as below.  Make sure that if you're asking me, I would be able to fill
such a form without needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to most
  questions.
