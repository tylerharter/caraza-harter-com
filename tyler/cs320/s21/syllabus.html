<p>Welcome to Data Programming II!  We'll be building on what you
learned in Data Programming I.  In that course, we mostly worried
about getting the code <b>correct</b> -- in the first part of 320,
we'll start thinking about how to make it <b>efficient</b>.  Next,
we'll be learning more about the <b>Internet</b> (among other things,
you'll build a simple website for distributing a dataset)
and <b>advanced visualizations</b> (like maps and animations).  We'll
conclude the course with a light introduction to <b>machine
    learning</b> with the sklearn package.

  <h3 class="mt-3">Revisions to Syllabus</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Sep 28: see new "Project Grading and Resubmit Policy" section
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-3">Project Grading and Resubmit Policy (added Sep 28)</h3>

<h5>Autograder Policy</h5>

<p>The autograder will be run periodically during 2 days days prior to
a project deadline (from Monday night if the deadline is on Wednesday
and so on). Because of this, we expect you to try submitting your
project early, and make sure nothing crashes. However, this should not
be a substitute for running test.py locally. You should only try
submitting once you pass the tests locally. The responsibility of
making sure your code does not crash is therefore placed on the
student.</p>

<h5>Resubmissions</h5>

<p>Unexpected Crash: If your code crashed/received significantly less
than expected and you had tried submitting it (and it ran
successfully) before the deadline, you will be able to resubmit up for
the next two days (until Friday if the deadline is on Wednesday) at
midnight without being penalized. In order for this to not be counted
as late, you will have to coordinate with your TA. Please mail your
group TA.</p>

<p>Other resubmit: If after the deadline you are not satisfied with the
grade the autograder gives you, you may resubmit afterwards but this
will eat into your late days.</p>

<p>Note that TAs will start grading submissions usually by the weekend
after the deadline. Therefore any submissions that are not submitted
by the next two days as mentioned above might not get
feedback. Special Cases: If there were extenuating circumstances
(e.g., documented illness) that prevented you from completing your
work on time, and you have insufficient late days remaining, please
speak with your instructor (Tyler). In general, if you're struggling
to keep up with the course for any reason, please set up an
appointment with the instructor (Tyler) to discuss how you can get
back on track.</p>

<h5>Packages</h5>

<p>Please use standard packages in python for the assignment.</p>

<p>The following packages are allowed for use in all the projects:
jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, beautifulsoup4,
statistics, recordclass, sklearn, haversine, gitpython, graphviz,
pylint, lxml, flask, bs4, html5lib, geopandas, shapely, descartes,
click, netaddr, torch==1.4.0+cpu, torch vision=0.5.0+cpu.</p>

<p>Using specialized packages will result in a score of zero when
submitted for grading. Please contact TA if you are not sure how to
code something without specialized packages or for the possibility to
use for specialised packages.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">About Being Online...</h3>

<p>A major advantage of in-person classes is that it's easy to meet
your peers and learn from them.  So one of my priorities for this
semester is to make sure you get to know at least a few of your fellow
students well.  To facilitate this, we'll be randomly placing all of
you in groups of 4-7.  Policies will strongly incentavize
collaboration within your group, though all work may still be done
individually for those who prefer.  Each group will meet together
(virtually) at a regular time weekly to discuss course content and
projects, starting in week 3.  A peer mentor (or sometimes a TA) will
join these meetings to help answer tough questions you may have.

<p>Being online can also have advantages, like scheduling flexibility and
the ability to self pace.  Aside from the weekly group meeting,
everything is asyncronous: lectures, labs, quizzes, and even the final.
As long as you keep ahead of the deadlines, you can decide when you
spend time on these things.

<p>I encourage you to take control of the pacing of lectures.  Say I'm
doing a coding demo in the lecture recording, and you've gotten a
little lost.  You should pause me and give it some thought -- or
better, type up the code yourself and play with it until it makes
sense!  Print more and think less.

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

There are a few ways to get help:
<ul>
  <li>Check for "walk"-in office hours (instructor, TA, and mentor): go to "Resources" menu and click "Office Hours"
  <li>Email your group's main TA (they'll reach out to you at the beginning of the semester)
  <li>Email me at tharter@wisc.edu to schedule an appointment outside of office hour time
</ul>

  <h3>Online Communication</h3>

<p>Besides email (described above), there are four ways we'll
  communicate outside of class.

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> You can ask questions (and see the other
  questions) <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kdhrwcjc95x5u4">here</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's considered
    cheating.</span>

<p><b>2. Canvas:</b> We'll make announcements on Canvas and
  periodically upload grades there (detailed feedback will only be on
  this site, however)

<p><b>3. Class Forms:</b> We have <a href="surveys.html">various
    forms</a> for us to leave (optionally anonymous) feedback and report
  exam conflicts.

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
  using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tool, TAs
  will leave comments on your code.  <span class="text-danger">Even
    projects scoring 100% often have a lot of room for improvement, so
    please take these seriously</span>.  When submitting, you can ask for
  specific kinds of feedback, based on what coding skills you're most
  interested in developing.

  <h3>Lab</h3>

<p>"Lab" consists of at-home exercises to help you understand topics
  and prepare for projects.

  <p>You can decide when to do labs each week, but I recommend finding
  a time when (a) other members of your group are also doing it, and
  (b) somebody is offering office hours.  Then, if you get stuck on
  something, you'll be able to get unstuck right away.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>56%</b> - 7 projects (8% each)
    <li><b>28%</b> - 12 quizzes (2% each)
    <li><b>12%</b> - final
    <li><b>8%</b> - participation
  </ul>

  <p>At the end, you'll have a score out of 100, and I'll set a curve.
    This is the first time I'm trying this format for the course, so I
    can't give a good estimate for what the cutoffs will be for
    various letter grades yet.

  <h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
  file or a .ipynb (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a group part
and (2) an individual part.  For the group part, any form of
help from anybody on your group is allowed (even looking at each
other's code); I recommend you find times for everybody on the group to
work at the same time so you can help each other through coding
difficulties in this part.  For the individual part, you may only
receive help from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you may not
discuss this part with anybody else (in the class or otherwise) or get
help from them.

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 7 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  You may use all your late
  days on the same project, if you like.  Using late days on a project
  does not defer the deadline for subsequent projects, so be careful
  not to let work pile up.  You <b>may not</b> use late days on the
  last project.  Late days are automatically applied if a project is
  turned in late.  After late days are exhausted, anything late will
  receive zero credit by default.  Please talk to me if you're falling
  this far behind.

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be largely based on automatic
  tests that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due
  date, so you should rarely be too surprised by your grade.  Though
  it shouldn't be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding,
  not following directions, or other issues.  Some bugs (called
  non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
  you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
  the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.
  Finally, our tests aren't very good at evaluating whether plots and
  other visualizations look how they should (a human usually needs to
  evaluate that).

  <h3>Quizzes</h3>

  <p>There will be a short quiz at the end of each week, on Canvas.  I recommend
  taking it soon after you've studied the week's content, but the
  deadline is generally Monday of the following week at 11:59pm
  (unless Monday is a holiday).  Make sure you know the rules
  regarding what is allowed and what is not.

    <h5>Allowed</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>however much time you need
        <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned group who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
        <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
        <li>searching online for general information
      </ul>

      <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>taking it more than once
          <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your group
          <li>discussing with members of your group who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
          <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
          <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
        </ul>

  <h3>Final</h3>

  <p>I'll post more details when this gets closer.  But basically,
  this will be an open-ended mini project on a topic of your choosing.
  It will be due at the final exam time posted in the student center.

  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>Some of the things that could count towards participation:

  <ul>
    <li>filling class surveys
    <li>attending weekly group meetings and bringing good questions
    <li>leaving good comments in posted discussions
    <li>completing relevant labs before projects
    <li>other...
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> by Al Sweigart: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Principles and Techniques of Data Science</i> by Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan: <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org/intro.html">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Scipy Lecture Notes</i> by many contributors: <a href="http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html">Read Online</a>
</ul>


<h3>Extra Support/Accomodations</h3>

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can be
barriers to learning. These might include isolation related to
COVID-19, strained relationships, anxiety, high levels of stress,
alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, loss of loved one, and/or loss of
motivation. Services exist on campus
to support students who find themselves in these situations, like University Health Services and
the Dean of Students Office. You can learn more about free,
confidential mental health services at UHS by calling 608-265-5600
Opt. 2 or visiting
<a href="https://uhs.wisc.edu">uhs.wisc.edu</a>. Drop-in staff are available daily at the Dean of
Students Office to support students and answer questions. To learn
more about the Dean of Students Office, please call 608-263-5700 or
visit <a href="https://doso.students.wisc.edu">doso.students.wisc.edu</a>.

<p>In general, if you have any issues keeping up with the course for
any reason, it's better to let me know -- I'll do my best to connect
you with resources and try to think of accomodations to help out.  I
want to do whatever I can to help you succeed.

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your group members on the group part of a project
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
    <li>any help from other students on the final (with citation)
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the group part from anybody who is not either (a) on your assigned group or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with &gt;100 students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
