      <h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Science Programming II!  In this course, we will learn
object-oriented programming to create tree and graph data structures
to represent hierarchical data and implement algorithms for
efficiently searching these structures.</p>

<p>We'll often create our own datasets, using techniques like logging,
benchmarking, web scraping, and A/B testing.</p>

<p>In the last third of the semester we'll explore some basic machine
learning techniques, including regression, classification, clustering,
and decomposition.</p>

  <li><b>Zoom Meetings: </b><a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/355770/external_tools/14065" target="_blank">Canvas - Zoom - Upcoming Meetings - CS320 SU23 Labs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  We'll post a weekly lab activities document. 
  During the lab, you will be assigned to a breakout room with your assigned study group, 
  and you can work on the lab activities individually or with your study group. 
  TAs and PMs will circulate breakout rooms to answer questions and check your progress in finishing the lab activities. 
  
<p>
  If you have extra time at the lab after completing the lab document, you can work with your assigned study group on projects or quizzes. 
  You cannot work on quizzes unless you have finished all lab activities and the current on-going project.
  
  There are five attendance points for each lab: 
  <ul>
    <li>2 for joining the breakout room no later than 5 minutes after the lab begins</li> 
    <li>3 for efficient progress on finishing the lab activities: 
      At the end of each lab, you need to submit screenshots of the work (code + running results) you have done so far to Canvas. 
      You don't have to finish every lab activity, but sufficient working progress is needed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>
  We message the class regularly via 
  <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/355770/announcements" target="_blank">Canvas announcements</a>.  
  We recommend updating your 
  <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication" target="_blank">Canvas settings</a> 
  so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately" so that you don't miss something important.
</p>

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help</a> page for details about how to contact us.

<p>
  We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
  (optionally anonymous) feedback, submit regrade request, and thank
  TAs/mentors.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>49%</b> - 7 projects (7% each, no drops)
    <li><b>7%</b> - online quizzes (1% each, 1 drop out of 8 quizzes)
    <li><b>11%</b> - midterm 1
    <li><b>11%</b> - midterm 2
    <li><b>15%</b> - final
    <li><b>4%</b> - lab attendance (6 drops out of 18 labs)
    <li><b>2%</b> - lecture attendance (14 drops out of 38 lectures)
    <li><b>1%</b> - class surveys
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Letter Grades</h3>

<p>At the end of the semester, we will assign final grades based on these thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% - 100%: <strong>A</strong></li>
<li>88% - 92.99%: <strong>AB</strong></li>
<li>80% - 87.99%: <strong>B</strong></li>
<li>75% - 79.99%: <strong>BC</strong></li>
<li>70% - 74.99%: <strong>C</strong></li>
<li>60% - 69.99% <strong>D</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Letter grade ranges include decimal points, 
  meaning we will <b>NOT</b> be rounding up scores at the end of the semester. 
  No extra credit is given in this course. 
</p>

<h3>Graded Component Details</h3>

<h4>Projects</h4>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
file, a .ipynb, or a zip (as specified) file for each project with
the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>. 
Every project has a regular deadline and a hard deadline. 
Hard deadline will always be 4-days after the regular deadline. 
Exception: p7's hard deadline will be the same as the regular deadline.</p>


<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a group part to be
optionally done with your assigned study group and (2) an individual
part.  For the group part, any form of help from anybody on your group
is allowed (even looking at each other's code); I recommend you find
times for everybody on the group to work at the same time so you can
help each other through coding difficulties in this part.  You're also
welcome to do the "group" part individually, or with a subset of your
assigned study group.  For the individual part, you may only receive help
from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you may not discuss this
part with anybody else (in the class or otherwise) or get help from
them. </p>

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>Students have a bank of 8 late days for the semester.
    <li>For a given project, you may use 2 late days without any deduction. 
      After that, 10% deduction per late day, for the next 2 days. 
      Projects which are late by more than 4 days will not be accepted.
    <li>For a given project, you cannot use more than 2 late days, 
      as deduction kicks in on the 3rd day.
    <li>After the bank runs out, 10% deduction will be applied per late day.
    <li>You <strong>may not</strong> use late days on the last project.
    <li>Late days only apply to projects. They do not apply to Quizzes.
    <li>Late days are automatically applied and do not need to be requested.
    <li>Late days are calculated as whole days. That is, even if your project is late by 2 hours, 
      that counts as 1 whole late day.
    <li>For calculating late days, we will always consider your last possible submission. 
      We will not be accepting requests to grade a prior submission for the same project.
  </ul>
</p>

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.</p>

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be largely based on automatic
tests that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due
date, so you should rarely be too surprised by your grade.  Though
it shouldn't be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding,
not following directions, or other issues.  Some bugs (called
non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.
Finally, our tests aren't very good at evaluating whether plots and
other visualizations look how they should (a human usually needs to
evaluate that).</p>

<p><b>Auto-grader:</b> The autograder will run hourly after the release of a project. 
Because of this, we expect you to try submitting your project early and make sure nothing
crashes. However, this should not be a substitute for running
tester.py locally. You should only try submitting once you pass the tests locally.
<ul>
	<li>Clearing the auto-grader is a <b>mandatory</b> part of the project submission process.</li>
	<li>If your project fails auto-grader, 
    it will be your responsibility to utilize office hours and make an appropriate resubmission.
    The resubmission will also be counted towards late day usage.</li>
	<li>Regular project deadlines will be applicable for autograder failures as well. 
    That is, your project submission must clear auto-grader within the hard deadline for a project. 
    If not, we are unable to grade your project submission.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Allowed Packages:</b> anything that comes pre-installed with
Python may be used.  Additionally, you may install and use the
following if they're useful: <i>jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
requests, beautifulsoup4, statistics, recordclass, sklearn, haversine,
gitpython, graphviz, pylint, lxml, flask, bs4, html5lib, geopandas,
shapely, descartes, click, netaddr, torch==1.4.0+cpu, torch
vision=0.5.0+cpu</i>.  Using unapproved packages may result in a
score of zero when submitted for grading because the autograder won't
be able to run your code without those packages.</p>

<h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Thursdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned study group who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your group
    <li>discussing with members of your group who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
  </ul>

<h4>Midterms and Final</h4>
  <p>These will be multiple choice exams taken through <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/355770/quizzes" target="_blank">Canvas - Quizzes</a> 
    with <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/services/honorlock/" target="_blank">HonorLock</a>.

<h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll sometimes assign readings from the following sources (all free):

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your assigned study group members on the group part of a project
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  
      If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the citation, you're plagarizing).
    <li>using ChatGPT to ask simple questions. For example: how do I use "self" inside a class constructor?
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>using ChatGPT to solve project questions in entirety - 
      please note that this will lead to your work getting detected by the plagiarism detector 
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the group part from anybody who is not either 
      (a) on your assigned study group or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>reporting lab attendance for yourself or someone else who didn't actually attend 
      (dropping in for a few minutes is not "attending")
    <li>counting lab attendance as merely showing up without spending substantial time on the assigned lab activities
    <li>using TopHat while not actually physically present in the room (since we sometimes use this for attendance)
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution at 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with about 400+ students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.
