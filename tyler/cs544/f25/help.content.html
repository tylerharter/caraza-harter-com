<h1 class="mt-5">Getting Help</h1>

  <h3>Piazza</h3>
<p>If you have a question of general interest, you can ask
    on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/m64hzy9v23v398">Piazza</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post project code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's
    considered cheating.</span>

  <p>We don't enable private questions on Piazza.  If you have a private
    question, we prefer email.</p>

  <h3>Email</h3>

<p>Everybody will be assigned a TA as their primary point of contact.  You can look up their <a href="messages.html?topic=ta">contact info here</a>.<p>

<p>If you don't hear back from your TA within 2 business days, feel free to CC the instructor on the same email thread (please do not start multiple threads with different people on the same topic).</p>

<p>In certain circumstances it may make sense to email the instructor directly first.  Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a conceptual question about lecture
  <li>you feel you're having trouble keeping up with the course
  <li>you have feedback about the course or a TA
</ul>

<p></p>
  
  <h3>Office Hours (In-Person and Zoom)</h3>
  
<p>Office hours are "walk in" during scheduled times -- no need to
email to setup an appointment.  Check the <a target="_blank"
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYPmLwUuzYKha8isG92M_S9_d3xE12TD0L648g1FjpQ/edit?usp=sharing">Office
Hour Schedule</a> to see your options.

<p>If you need an instructor appointment outside of office hours, please email me (tharter@wisc.edu) about availability.

  <p>If you need to followup with somebody after office hours, you can
  look up members of the teaching team by
  face <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/478879/pages/teaching-team">here</a>.
  Most of the time though you should be emailing one of the following:
  your assigned TA, TA that graded you, head TA, or the instructor.

<h3>Extra Support/Accomodations</h3>

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can be
barriers to learning. These might include isolation related to
COVID-19, strained relationships, anxiety, high levels of stress,
alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, loss of loved one, and/or loss of
motivation. Services exist on campus
to support students who find themselves in these situations, like University Health Services and
the Dean of Students Office. You can learn more about free,
confidential mental health services at UHS by calling 608-265-5600
Opt. 2 or visiting
<a href="https://uhs.wisc.edu">uhs.wisc.edu</a>. Drop-in staff are
available daily at the Office of Student Assistance and Support (OSAS)
to support students and answer questions. To learn more about OSAS,
please call 608-263-5700 or
visit <a href="https://osas.wisc.edu">osas.wisc.edu</a>.

<p>In general, if you have any issues keeping up with the course for
any reason, it's better to let me know -- I'll do my best to connect
you with resources and try to think of accomodations to help out.  I
want to do whatever I can to help you succeed.

<h3>Student Grievance Procedure</h3>

<p>Any student at UWâ€“Madison who feels that they have been treated
unfairly has the right to voice a complaint and receive a prompt
hearing of the grievance. The basis for a grievance can range from
something as subtle as miscommunication to the extreme of harassment.

<p>Ensuring that all students feel welcome and supported is a top
priority of our department. The Department of Computer Sciences has
developed procedures to handle complaints or incidents that are
student-related, such as bias or mistreatment, or academic, such as a
grade dispute or incident with an instructor. Information on the CS
reporting procedures can be found
here: <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/report-an-incident/">https://www.cs.wisc.edu/report-an-incident/</a>.

<p>For assistance in determining options, students can also contact
the drop-in staff member with OSAS (see above).
