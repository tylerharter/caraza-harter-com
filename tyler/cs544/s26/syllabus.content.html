<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Intro to Big Data Systems!  We'll deploy and use
distributed systems to store and analyze large datasets. Unstructured
and structured approaches to storage will be covered. Analysis will
involve learning new query languages, processing streaming data, and
training machine learning models.  Systems covered include Docker,
  PyTorch, HDFS, Spark, Cassandra, Kafka, and more.

      </ul>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture
  schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.

<p>I'll ask questions during lecture via TopHat.  Though
in-person attendance is not required, you can earn extra credit by
answering these correctly.  Answering TopHat questions remotely is not
permitted.

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

  <p>We'll be learning about many different big data systems, and so
  no textbook closely corresponds to the lecture content.  Thus,
  attending lectures and taking notes will be your primary
    resource.</p>

  <p>We will have recommended (though optional) readings for many
  systems, however.  We'll select from O'Reilly text books because you
    can read them free online via the Madison Public Library.  You just need to do the following:

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/library-cards/get-a-card#getcard">get a library card (free)</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/eresources/oreilly-public-libraries-tech-ebooks-and-digital-learning">sign into the O'Reilly collection with your card number</a>
      <li>search for the assigned book
    </ol>
  
  <p>Here are some of the main texts we'll reference this semester:

    <ul>
      <li>Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems (1st edition), by Martin Kleppmann
      <li>Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics (2nd edition), by Jules Damji <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, (Revised) Third Edition:
      Distributed Data at Web Scale 3rd Edition (3rd edition), by Jeff Carpenter <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Kafka: The Definitive Guide: Real-Time Data and Stream Processing at Scale (2nd Edition), by Gwen Shapira <i>et al.</i>
    </ul>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We message the class regularly
via Canvas announcements.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help page</a> for details about how to
contact us.

<p>We have <a href="forms.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
    (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank
    TAs.

<h3>Course Components</h3>

There will be an opportunity to earn 104 points during the semester (100 regular points and 4 extra credit points).

<p>Point distribution
  <ul>
    <li>Final Exam (20 points)
    <li>3 Midterms (12 points each, 36 points total)
    <li>Online Policy Quiz (2 points)
    <li>8 Programming Projects (3 points each, 24 points total)
    <li>6 Hand-in Worksheets (2 points each, 12 points total)
    <li>2 Skill Demos (3 points each, 6 points total)
    <li>4 Extra Credit Points (for TopHat, Instructor Endorsements on Piazza, etc)
  </ul>

<p>Grade thresholds will be applied to points (not percents!) as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>A &gt;= 94
    <li>AB &gt;= 90
    <li>B &gt;= 82
    <li>BC &gt;= 72
    <li>C &gt;= 65
    <li>D &gt;= 60
    <li>F &lt; 60
  </ul>

  <h4>Exams</h4>

<p>There will be 3 in-class midterms and a final exam during finals week.  All exams are cumulative.  They will usually be a mix of multiple choice questions and others (e.g., short answer, or illustrating how a system works).  These will all be closed book/notes.

<p>The final exam will be Tuesday, May 5, 2026, 5:05-7:05 PM.

<p><b>Missed Midterm Policy:</b> You may miss up to 2 midterms.  The first miss is no questions asked, and the second time you must provide credible medical evidence or proof of travel to your instructor.  If you are not able to take any midterms, other options such as <a href="https://registrar.wisc.edu/medical-withdrawal/">medical withdrawal</a> should be considered.  You must communicate midterm misses via the <a href="forms.html">miss form</a> as soon as possible, and no later than the day of the midterm.

<p>At the end of the semester, the grade percent for your validly-missed midterms will be replaced with your percent on the final.  This is basically equivalent to putting more weight on the final.  The final exam cannot be skipped, nor taken before the regular time.  It may only rescheduled to a later date, if necessary.

  <h4>Online Policy Quiz</h4>

<p>There is an online quiz covering course policies. You may repeat this quiz as many times as you like. If the instructor believes it is necessary for a student to review course policies, the instructor may clear their score, requiring them to take it again.
  
  <h4>Projects</h4>

  <p>There will be 8 substantial programming projects.  AI policy will vary by project, to expose you to different tools (check the specific policy for each project).  These can optionally be done with a single partner.

    <h4>Hand-in Worksheets</h4>

    <p>We will do a variety of non-graded worksheets in class.  You do not need to hand these in.  We will also have 4 that you must hand in (we will share more details about which ones, and when this is).

    <h4>Skill Demos</h4>

    <p>Two times during the semester, you will need to schedule a time to demonstrate certain skills on a virtual machine to a TA.  We communicate more details about this.

      <h4>Extra Credit</h4>
      
<p>The extra credit opportunities will add up to more than 4, but nobody can earn more than 4 extra credit points in the course.  One TopHat points will be worth 0.2 course points in the extra credit category.
      
<h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>

  <h4>Project Policies</h4>

  <p>Be sure to read and understand the full project collaboration
    policies <a href="https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs544/s26/main/-/blob/main/projects.md">here</a>.

    <h4>TopHat Policies</h4>

    <p>TopHat questions are intended for in-class participants.
    Students who submit any TopHat question remotely are not eligible
    for any extra credit for the course.  We might notice this by
    passing around a sign-up sheet following a TopHat question.

      <h4>Piazza Policies</h4>

      <p>Do not post project code snippets that are >5 lines long.

      <h4>Exam Policies</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>students who have not taken an exam yet may study/prep with other students who have already taken it; unless you have first-hand knowledge that another student has taken an exam, assume they have not taken it
        <li>you may not sit adjacent to anybody you have met or know (even slightly)
      </ul>    

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
