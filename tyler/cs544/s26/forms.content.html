<h1 class="mt-5">Class Forms</h1>

<p>For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to fill in this
  form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to verify who you
  are.  If you try using a different signin on one of these, you'll
  see an error saying "You need permission: This form can only be
  viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>
