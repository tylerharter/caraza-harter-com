<h1 class="mt-5">Class Forms</h1>

<p>For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to fill in this
  form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to verify who you
  are.  If you try using a different signin on one of these, you'll
  see an error saying "You need permission: This form can only be
  viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>

class or suggestions for improvement, please let us know sooner rather
than later.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/rp5HyXLfcjKL9chf8">3. Thank You!</a>
    Has a TA provided exceptional help, during office hours, piazza, etc?
    Thank them by filling out this form, and I'll pass along the
  feedback.

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/dotfAaw7dRVQsTPj6">4. Partner Form</a>
For each project, you should fill this once to indicate whether you're
doing the project alone or with a partner.  Only one partner should do
the submission.  You can change partners each project, but not during
a project.  Do NOT submit a person as your partner unless you've
discussed with them in advance and mutually agreed to work together.
  

<p>For forms requiring authentication, make sure you sign in with your @wisc.edu, like this:
