<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Intro to Big Data Systems!  We'll deploy and use
distributed systems to store and analyze large datasets. Unstructured
and structured approaches to storage will be covered. Analysis will
involve learning new query languages, processing streaming data, and
training machine learning models.  Systems covered include Docker,
  PyTorch, HDFS, Spark, Cassandra, Kafka, and more.

      </ul>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture
  schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.

<p>I'll ask questions during lecture
via <a href="https://app.tophat.com/e/728304">TopHat</a>.  Answering
questions (and getting them correct) will help your participation
  score, though perfect attendance is not necessary for full credit.

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

  <p>We'll be learning about many different big data systems, and so
  no textbook closely corresponds to the lecture content.  Thus,
  attending lectures and taking notes will be your primary
    resource.</p>

  <p>We will have recommended (though optional) readings for many
  systems, however.  We'll select from O'Reilly text books because you
    can read them free online via the Madison Public Library.  You just need to do the following:

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/library-cards/get-a-card#getcard">get a library card (free)</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/eresources/oreilly-public-libraries-tech-ebooks-and-digital-learning">sign into the O'Reilly collection with your card number</a>
      <li>search for the assigned book
    </ol>
  
  <p>Here are some of the main texts we'll reference this semester:

    <ul>
      <li>Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems (1st edition), by Martin Kleppmann
      <li>Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics (2nd edition), by Jules Damji <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, (Revised) Third Edition:
      Distributed Data at Web Scale 3rd Edition (3rd edition), by Jeff
        Carpenter <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python, by Sebastian Raschka <i>et al.</i>
    </ul>

    <p>Sometimes we may post lecture notes too.</p>
  
      
<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We message the class regularly
via <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/374194/announcements">Canvas
announcements</a>.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help page</a> for details about how to contact us.

<p>We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
    (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank
    TAs.


<h3>Course Components</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li>Midterm (15%)
    <li>Final (20%)
    <li>12 quizzes (12% total)
    <li>8 programming projects (6% each, 48% total)
    <li>participation (5% total)
  </ul>

<p>At the end of the semester, you'll have a score out of 100, and
I'll set a curve based on where there are obvious breaks in the
distribution and the difficulty this semester (there are not a capped
numbers of A's, so you're not really competing with your peers).
  
  <h4>Exams</h4>

  <p>These will be multiple choice exams taken in person.  The midterm
  will be in class, the final will be at a different location (to be
  announced).
  
  <h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Wednesdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h5>Allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>however much time you need
    <li>discussing answers with classmates who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
    <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
    <li>searching online for general information
    <li>running code
  </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of the course
    <li>discussing with classmates who have already completed the quiz when you haven't completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other students who broke the preceding rule
    <li>getting TA/instructor help on quiz questions prior to the quiz deadline
  </ul>

  <h4>Projects</h4>

  <p>See project policies <a href="https://github.com/cs544-wisc/s23/blob/main/projects.md">here</a>.
  
  <h4>Participation</h4>

  <p>Some of the things that count towards participation:

    <ul>
      <li>TopHat (most important)
      <li>filling class surveys
      <li>accepted pull requests fixing issues with project specifications
      <li>instructor endorsed piazza contributions (be sure to use your NETID@wisc.edu email so we can identify you)
      <li>other...
  </ul>

<h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>

<p>Code copying between students is not allowed in this course, except
between project partners.  Copying includes emailing, taking photos,
looking while typing line by line, etc.  Copying code then changing it
is still copying and thus not allowed.  Lock your compute when it's
  not attended.

  <p>Be sure to read and understand the full project collaboration policies <a href="https://github.com/cs544-wisc/f23/blob/main/projects.md">here</a>.

<p><b>Citing ChatGPT (or other LLMs):</b> it's allowed with proper citation (see above link for details).

<p><b>Citing Online Resources:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied/adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project you find online
  (that accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not
  OK.  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is
  to be completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
