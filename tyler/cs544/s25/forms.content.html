<h1 class="mt-5">Class Forms</h1>

<p>For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to fill in this
  form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to verify who you
  are.  If you try using a different signin on one of these, you'll
  see an error saying "You need permission: This form can only be
  viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>

target="_blank">2. Office Hour Feedback Form.</a>  Let us know whether
office hours were useful.  We're looking for ways to improve, and also
appreciate positive feedback!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbuI3DTPZoapJLmAQz-hlz5Ts5bddL2uu7neg5wa6EUmSIPg/viewform">3. Partner Form.</a>
For each project, you should fill this once to indicate whether you're
doing the project alone or with a partner.  Only one partner should do
the submission.  You can change partners each project, but not during
a project.  Do NOT submit a person as your partner unless you've
discussed with them in advance and mutually agreed to work together.

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/55MaZ2k7UJuZP92a7">4. Exam Reweigting
Request</a>.  Fill this if you need to miss exam 1 and/or exam 2 and
want to reweight.  Submitting the form does not guarantee approval
(that must be explicit via an email from the instructor).  Exam 3 is
not missable, only reschedulable.

<p>For forms requiring authentication, make sure you sign in with your @wisc.edu, like this:
