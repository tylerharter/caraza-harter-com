<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Intro to Big Data Systems!  We'll deploy and use
distributed systems to store and analyze large datasets. Unstructured
and structured approaches to storage will be covered. Analysis will
involve learning new query languages, processing streaming data, and
training machine learning models.  Systems covered include Docker,
  PyTorch, HDFS, Spark, Cassandra, Kafka, and more.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>Deploy distributed systems for data storage and analytics
	<li>Demonstrate competencies with tools and processes necessary for loading data into distributed storage systems
	<li>Write programs that use distributed platforms to efficiently analyze large datasets

      </ul>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

<p>We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture
  schedule <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.

<p>I'll ask questions during lecture
via <a href="https://app.tophat.com/e/538434">TopHat</a>.  Though
in-person attendance is not required, you can earn extra credit by
answering these correctly.  Answering TopHat questions remotely is not
permitted.

  <h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

  <p>We'll be learning about many different big data systems, and so
  no textbook closely corresponds to the lecture content.  Thus,
  attending lectures and taking notes will be your primary
    resource.</p>

  <p>We will have recommended (though optional) readings for many
  systems, however.  We'll select from O'Reilly text books because you
    can read them free online via the Madison Public Library.  You just need to do the following:

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/library-cards/get-a-card#getcard">get a library card (free)</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/eresources/oreilly-public-libraries-tech-ebooks-and-digital-learning">sign into the O'Reilly collection with your card number</a>
      <li>search for the assigned book
    </ol>
  
  <p>Here are some of the main texts we'll reference this semester:

    <ul>
      <li>Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems (1st edition), by Martin Kleppmann
      <li>Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics (2nd edition), by Jules Damji <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, (Revised) Third Edition:
      Distributed Data at Web Scale 3rd Edition (3rd edition), by Jeff
        Carpenter <i>et al.</i>
      <li>Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python, by Sebastian Raschka <i>et al.</i>
    </ul>

    <p>Sometimes we may post lecture notes too.</p>
  
      
<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>We message the class regularly
via <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/427528/announcements">Canvas
announcements</a>.  We recommend updating
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/profile/communication">Canvas
settings</a> so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately"
so that you don't miss something important.

<p>See the <a href="help.html">help page</a> for details about how to
contact us.

<p>We have <a href="surveys.html">various forms</a> for us to leave
    (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank
    TAs.

<h3>Course Components</h3>

There will be an opportunity to earn 104 points during the semester (100 regular points and 4 extra credit points).

<p>Point distribution
  <ul>
    <li>3 Exams (19 points each, 57 points total)
    <li>11 quizzes (1 point each, 11 points total)
    <li>8 programming projects (4 points each, 32 points total)
    <li>4 extra credit points (for TopHat, Instructor Endorsements on Piazza, etc)
  </ul>

<p>Grade thresholds will be applied to points (not percents!) as follows:

  <ul>
    <li>A &gt;= 94
    <li>AB &gt;= 90
    <li>B &gt;= 82
    <li>BC &gt;= 72
    <li>C &gt;= 65
    <li>D &gt;= 60
    <li>F &lt; 60
  </ul>

<p>The extra credit opportunities will add up to more than 4, but nobody can earn more than 4 extra credit points in the course.  One TopHat points will be worth 0.2 course points in the extra credit category.

  <h4>Exams</h4>

  <p>These will be multiple choice and taken in person.  Exams 1+2
  will be during class, and exam 3 will be during finals week.  All
    exams are cumulative.

  <p>If you must miss an exam (e.g., due to illness), the others will
  receive greater weight, without scaling.  For example, if you only
  do exam 1 and 3, then those will each be worth 28.5% (assuming you
  were explicitly excused from exam 2 by the instructor).  If you are
  excused from taking both exams 1+2, then exam 3 will be worth 57%.
  Exam 3 cannot be skipped (only rescheduled to a later date, if
  necessary).

  <h4>Quizzes</h4>

  <p>There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most
  Wednesdays.  Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed
  and what is not.

  <h4>Projects</h4>

  <p>See project policies <a href="https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs544/f24/main/-/blob/main/projects.md">here</a>.

<h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>

  <h4>Project Policies</h4>

  <p>Be sure to read and understand the full project collaboration
    policies <a href="https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs544/f24/main/-/blob/main/projects.md">here</a>.

    <h4>TopHat Policies</h4>

    <p>TopHat questions are intended for in-class participants.
    Students who submit any TopHat question remotely are not eligible
    for any extra credit for the course.  We might notice this by
    passing around a sign-up sheet following a TopHat question.

      <h4>Piazza Policies</h4>

      <p>Do not post project code snippets that are >5 lines long.
      
      <h4>Exam Policies</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>students who have not taken an exam yet may study/prep with other students who have not taken it yet; it is fine to collaborate on creating note sheets (when allowed)
        <li>students who have taken an exam may not discuss/share with a student who has not taken the exam yet; unless you have first-hand knowledge that another student has taken an exam, assume they have not taken it
        <li>you may not sit adjacent to anybody you have met or know (event slightly)
      </ul>

    <h4>Quiz Policies</h4>
    
    <h5>Allowed</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>however much time you need
      <li>discussing answers with classmates who are taking the quiz <b>at the same time</b>
      <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
      <li>searching online for general information
      <li>running code
    </ul>

  <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>taking it more than once
    <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of the course
    <li>discussing with classmates who have already completed the quiz when you have not completed it yourself yet
    <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
    <li>using such material potentially posted by other students who broke the preceding rule
    <li>getting TA/instructor help on quiz questions prior to the quiz deadline
  </ul>    

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
